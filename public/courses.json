The goal is to understand the manner in which humans interact with, and use, their computers for productive work. The course focus is on the interface as designed artifact. The interface is a design problem without a single correct solution but which has many good solutions and a plethora of bad solutions. Class discussion centers on what makes an interface good and proven techniques for designing interfaces that meet human needs.",

The material in the course builds on that knowledge via a series of semantics preserving transformations that start with a fairly high-level programming language and culminate in machine code.",
